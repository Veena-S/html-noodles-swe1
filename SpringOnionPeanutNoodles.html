    <p>Preparation Time: <em>15 minutes</em></p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 ml) toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
        <li>5 large spring onions</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp sriracha/ chili paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 ml) gluten free soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 ml) maple, agave, honey or sugar (or maple/agave for vegan option)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (16 g) smooth, natural peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 ml) rice vinegar or lime juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) water</li>
        <li>10 oz Gluten Free Soba Noodles (or rice noodles)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Sesame seeds for topping, black and/or white</li>

    </ol>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prep the green onions: remove the root ends of the green onions and discard. Then cut the green onions in
            half separating the light, hard bottoms from the dark green/leafy tops. Chop the lighter bottoms until into
            small pieces (these will be cooked first) and slice the dark green tops of the green onions lengthwise into
            1 inch long pieces.</li>
        <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions. Soba noodles will usually cook in boiled water about 7
            minutes. Once cooked, pour the noodles into a colander and run under cold water to remove the starch and
            make the noodles less sticky. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Warm the sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over a medium. Add the garlic, ginger and chopped green onion
            pieces to the oil and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sriracha, soy sauce, sweetener, vinegar and peanut butter to the pan and stir into a thick paste.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the water and bring to a gentle simmer. Let the mixture cook until it thickens - about 1-2 minutes.
            Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the noodles to the pan along with the sliced green onion tops. Toss in sauce and coat the noodles well.
        </li>
        <li>Serve topped with sesame seeds and enjoy hot or cold.</li>
